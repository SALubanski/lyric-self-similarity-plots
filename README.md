# lyric-self-similarity-plots
Creates Self-similarity plots (also known as "recurrence plots") from song lyrics. I'm using R to replicate Colin Morris' work at [SongSim](https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/#/about) which was featured on Vox's "Earworm" series, episode 5, titled: ["Why we really really really like repetition in music"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzzmqUoQobc). 

## For example, here is a self-similarity plot using Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger":
