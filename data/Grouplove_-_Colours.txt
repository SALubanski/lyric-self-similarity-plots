
I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I run around, round, round, round this down town and act like I don't care.
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon,
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you.

Huh.
Ha

So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head.
And I see black, black, green,and brown, brown, brown and blue, yellow, violets, red.
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days and know that I have changed.

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad.
It really ain't that bad.

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad.
You've still got your health

So Mistress, Mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self
There's blood on the wall
'Cause he couldn't face the truth.

Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends,
You'll be back again, gain
Before it's too late.

It's the colors you have 
No need to be sad.
It really ain't that bad.

Oooooooooh, It's the colors you have
No need to be sad.
It really ain't that bad

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad.
You've still got your health

So I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I float around, 'round, 'round this downtown
And know I shouldn't care.
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain
If everything's changed
Just know that you don't know.

We call it... Life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it.
We can't call it at all.
We call it... Life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it.
When you can't call it Woah-ooohhh
Yeah, We call it Woah-ooohhh
That's what we call it.
Woah-ooohhh
We do it for love, sweet love.
