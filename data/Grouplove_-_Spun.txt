
I want it rag-tag life in a bag 
I've been sleeping in a bus mistrust singing lalalala
I got the feeling I've been nickel and dimed
That was probably in line for the semiconscious state of mind 
Rush rush rush for the gold dust scattered too much 
I'm sippin cocktails, fish scales, falling for love
I'm falling for love

Reason reason reason, is gone….Don't go! 
Spun (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
Don't go (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
Yeah reason, reason reason is gone! (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
I'm spun (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?)

I want it rag-tag love in a bag 
Volume five, drip dry, Lo-Fi, singing lalalala 
Rush rush rush down in the sound 
It's your ride, top side, high tide,
Free falling below 
I'm falling for love

Reason reason reason is gone... so long! 
Spun (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
I'm gone (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
Yeah reason, reason, reason is gone (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
I'm spun (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) (are you lonesome, are you, are you lonesome?) 
HA, HA, HA! SPUN Oooohh ohhhh oooh
