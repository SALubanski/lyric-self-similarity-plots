Woo!

Be a man can a mystery man
Be a doll be a baby doll
It can't be fun not anyway
It can't be found no way at all
A distant man can't sympathise
He can't uphold his distant laws
Due to form on that today
I got a feeling then I hear this call

I said neat neat neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat neat neat
She can't afford a gun at all
Neat neat neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat neat neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat neat neat

No crime if there ain't no law
No more cops left to mess you around
No more dreams of mystery chords
No more sight to bring you down
I got a crazy got a thought in my mind
My mind's on when she falls asleep
Feelin' fine in her restless time
Then these words upon me creep

I said neat neat neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat neat neat
She can't afford a gun at all
Neat neat neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat neat neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat neat neat

Be a man can a mystery man
Be a doll like a baby doll
It can't be fun not anyway
It can't be found no way at all
A distant man can't sympathise
Can't uphold his distant laws
Due to form on that today
I got a feeling then I hear that call

I said neat neat neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat neat neat
She can't afford a gun at all
Neat neat neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat neat neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat neat neat
