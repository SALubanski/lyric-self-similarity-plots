Milk and honey for my body
C'mon through the door, see
It's your unborn self
(Seen it before)
Fake soul-butter
Made of rubber
Stick it in the skin, see
It's a wealth of life!
Gamma knife!

Gamma knife
Gamma knife
Gamma knife
Gamma knife
Nice
Knife
Gamma knife

Crack the whip
I'll jump the hoop
(Gamma!)
Cut the skin
And bend the truth
(Gamma!)
All I wanted was my youth
(Gamma!)
All in favor of this truth
Gamma knife!
