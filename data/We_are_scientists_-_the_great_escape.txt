Making my escape
Making my escape
Tell myself that everything's in shape
Everything's in shape
But me

How long can this take?
How long can this take?
Tell myself that everything is great
Everything is great
Well, how am I doin'?

I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
While everything is adding up, up, up
Everything is adding up, up, up

Breakin' both my hands
Breakin' both my hands
Tellin' me to take it like a man
Take it like a man
I can't

I don't understand
I don't understand
Please repeat whatever you just said
Nothing's makin' sense
Well, how am I doin'?

I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
While everything is adding up, up, up
Everything is adding up, up, up

They're breakin' both my hands
They're breakin' both my hands
They're tellin' me to take it like a man
Take it like a man
Well fuck that

I don't understand
Said I don't understand
Said please repeat whatever you just said
'Cause nothing's makin' sense
Well, how am I doin'?

I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
While everything is adding up, up, up
Everything is adding up, up, up
