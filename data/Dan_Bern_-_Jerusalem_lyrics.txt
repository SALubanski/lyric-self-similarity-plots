
when I tell you that I love you
don't test my love
accept my love, don't test my love
cause maybe I don't love you all that much

don't ask what kind of music I’m gonna play tonight
just stay awhile, hear for yourself awhile
and if you must put me in a box, make sure it's a big box
with lots of windows
and a door to walk through
and a nice high chimney
so we can burn burn burn everything that we don't like 
and watch the ashes fly up to heaven
maybe all the way to india
i'd like that

all the ancient kings came to my door
they said "do you want to be an ancient king too?"
I said "oh yes very much
but I think my timing's wrong"
they said "time is relative
or did you misread einstien"
I said "do you really mean it?"
they said "what do you think we come here for
our goddamn health or something?"

everybody's waiting for the messiah
the jews are waiting
the christians are waiting
oh so are the muslims
it's like everybody's waiting
they been waiting a long time
I know how I hate to wait
like even for a bus or something
an important phone call
so I can imagine how darned impatient
everyone must be getting

so I think it's time now
time to reveal myself
I am the messiah
I am the messiah

yes I think you heard me right
I am the messiah
I was gonna wait till next year
build up the suspense a little
make it a really big surprise 
but I could not resist
it's like when you got a really big secret
you're just bursting to tell someone
it was kinda like that with this
and now that I’ve told you
I feel this great weight lifted
dr. nusbaum was right
he's my therapist
he said get it out in the open

I spent ten whole days in jerusalem
mmmm jerusalem sweet jerusalem
and all I ate was olives
nothing but olives
mountains of olives
it was a good ten days
I like olives
I like you too

so when I tell you that I love you
don't test my love
accept my love, don't test my love
cause maybe I don't love you all that much
