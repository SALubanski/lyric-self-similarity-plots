I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years

I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)

[Chorus]
You can't stand to see me that way
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
You can't stand to see me that way
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you)

[Chorus]
You can't stand to see me that way
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
You can't stand to see me that way
Yeah! Yeah!
