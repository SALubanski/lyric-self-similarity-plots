
Faster
Faster, faster

You
Since that magic day
We've been like magnets in a play
We smash in, then pull away
Every day ''(Every day)''

You, you
You're a jet, a flying gun
You kill me softly with your sun
You melt my wings, then call it fun
I should run

''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster, faster I should run 
''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster from your arms 
''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster I should run 
''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster from your arms 
''(Ohhh)''

I
Watch my powers die
Falling out of starry skies ''(Out starry skies)''
You kryptonite my life
Every night ''(Faster, faster)''

Oh the
The ending of the road
Dashing prince or horny toad?
Who really ever knows?
I should know

''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster I should run 
''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster from your arms 
''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster I should run 
''(Ohhh faster, faster, faster, faster)''
Faster and faster from your arms 
''(Ohhh)''

Mmm yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm runnin'
I'm runnin'
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin'
(Shakin' like a schizo)
I'm shakin' like
Shakin' like a schizo
('lectric sheep)
'lectric sheep all over my beat 
(Dancing in the window)
They dancin', dancin', dancin' in the window
(My heart beats)
My heart beats
It beats for you and only you
(It's kickin' like a kick drum)
And it's kicking like a kick kick drum

(Am I free?)
Am I a-free?
Uh, am I a-free?
(Just another weirdo)
Or just another little weirdo?
(Call me weak)
Call me weak
Or better yet, you can call me
(Just call me your hero)
You can call me your hero, baby

You can't clamp down all my good times
I know right from wrong
Kissing loving's feeling good
It knocked this feeling down
You hide your chainsaw deep in kisses
That don't make it quiet
You got me running, muttering, screaming
Each and every night

Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms 

Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms 

Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms
