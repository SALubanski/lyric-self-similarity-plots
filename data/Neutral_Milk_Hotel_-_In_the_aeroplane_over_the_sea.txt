
What a beautiful face I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
What a beautiful dream that could flash
On the screen in a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet let me hold it close and keep it here
With me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be in the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life we have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anne's ghost all around hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through your mouth
To make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
Our secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
When we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
